The Automatic System is rapid and is or feels instinctive,
and it does not involve what we usually associate with the
word thinking.

The Reflective System is more deliberate and selfconscious. 
We use the Reflective System when we are asked, “How much is 411 times 37?”

One way to think about all this is that the Automatic
System is your gut reaction and the Reflective System is
your conscious thought. Gut feelings can be quite accurate,
but we often make mistakes because we rely too much on
our Automatic System. The Automatic System says that “the
airplane is shaking, I’m going to die,” while the Reflective
System responds, “Planes are very safe!”
