//5.16 (Bar-Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of computers is to display
//graphs and bar charts. Write an application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30. //For each number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of adjacent //asterisks. For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should display *******. //Display the bars of asterisks after you read all five numbers.
