5.5 Describe the four basic elements of counter-controlled iteration.
1. must be initialized
2. must be given value


5.6 Compare and contrast the while and for iteration statements.
Ans: The while loop is good for sentinel controlled iteration and the for loop is good for counter controlled iteration, also the for loop is a standalone.


5.7 If you need to execute the body of a loop at least once, would it be better to use a doâ€¦while statement or a while statement?

Ans: would be better to use a do... while statement, because the do... while statement execute the body of a loop at least once to confirm if the condition is true or false.

5.8 Compare and contrast the break and continue statements.

Ans: The break statement stops the execution at the exact state once it stumble on a true condition, while the continue statement continues the execution but it will omits the exact condition when running and continues the rest execution.
