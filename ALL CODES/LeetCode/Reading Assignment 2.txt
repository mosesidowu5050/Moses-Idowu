* The Love Letter & the Breakup Letter

The love letter, and the breakup letter, are two methods that allow 
people to express their sentiments about a product or a service 
using a medium and a format that are immediately understood. 

Instead of writing to a person, however, participants are asked to personify 
a product and write a personal message to it. The results are often unexpectedly 
deep and revealing about the relationships people have with the products 
and services in their lives.

* Picture Cards
The powerful essence of the picture card method lies in the stories told, 
allowing people to see their life experiences, revealing complexity and 
patterns to themselves and to the researcher.

*  POEMS
Studying people, objects, environments, messages, and services in a context.

A team researching a specific product using the POEMS framework would 
look beyond object (the product) to services, messages, environments, and 
people that have a relationship with the broader context in which that product 
is used.


* Five Human Factors
Studying physical, cognitive, social, cultural, and emotional factors that drive
overall user experience.

This research method breaks down a personâ€™s experience into its constituent 
parts to understand each in detail, and then reassembles our findings to 
understand how they form an overall experience.

* 1.4 How to discover user needs
Having a direct contact with the users, the target group of people who will 
use an innovative product or our service regularly in the future.

It stands to reason that an innovation only works when we have internalized 
the needs of our users and developed a thorough understanding of them. 
It can be achieved when we are where they are, especially when we witness 
the part of their life we want to improve.
