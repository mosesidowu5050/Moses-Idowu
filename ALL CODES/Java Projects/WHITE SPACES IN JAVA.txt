What are white spaces?(5)

White spaces are used to separate tokens (keywords, variables, operators etc.) in the code, making it more readable and organized. 

Whitespace are not visible but it plays a crucial role in making the code readable and structured.


What are white spaces used for?
1. Separating Tokens: Whitespace is used to separate different parts of a statement, such as keywords, operators, variables, and values.

2. Improving Readability: Whitespace makes code easier.

3. Formatting Code: Whitespace is also used to create blank lines for better separation between logical blocks of code.

4. Command-Line Arguments: In many programming languages, including Java, whitespace separates command-line arguments passed to the program.

What does the main method do?

main: This is the name of the method. The JVM looks for a method named main to start program execution.
The main method is where the program starts executing. When you run a Java application, the JVM looks for the main method and starts running the code inside it.

Where Execution Begins: The program starts executing from the main method, which is required for any standalone Java application.

Command-line Arguments: The main method can accept an array of strings (String[] args) which hold the arguments passed to the program when it's run from the command line.

No Return Value: The main method is defined as void, meaning it does not return any value to the operating system when it finishes executing.
