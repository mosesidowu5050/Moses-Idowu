"""
3.12 (Palindromes) A palindrome is a number, word or text phrase that reads the same
backwards or forwards. For example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554 and 11611. Write a script that reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether itâ€™s a palindrome. [Hint: Use the // and % operators to separate the number into its digits.]
